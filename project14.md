## EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WITH JENKINS | ANSIBLE | ARTIFACTORY | SONARQUBE | PHP


### What is Continuous Integration?
In software engineering, Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice of merging all developersâ€™ working copies to a shared mainline (e.g., Git Repository or some other version control system) several times per day. Frequent merges reduce chances of any conflicts in code and allow to run tests more often to avoid massive rework if something goes wrong. This principle can be formulated as Commit early, push often.

### Continuous Integration in The Real World

### Common Best Practices of CI/CD

Principles that define a reliable and robust CI/CD pipeline:

```
- Maintain a code repository
- Automate build process
- Make builds self-tested
- Everyone commits to the baseline every day
- Every commit to baseline should be built
- Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case
- Keep the build fast
- Test in a clone of production environment
- Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
- Everyone can see the results of the latest build
- Automate deployment (if you are confident enough in your CI/CD pipeline and willing to go for a fully automated Continuous Deployment)
```

### Running Ansible Playbook from Jenkins

Now that you have a broad overview of a typical Jenkins pipeline. Let us get the actual Ansible deployment to work by:


1. Installing Ansible plugin in Jenkins UI
2. Creating Jenkinsfile from scratch. (Delete all you currently have in there and start all over to get Ansible to run successfully)

Note: Ensure that Ansible runs against the Dev environment successfully.

Parameterizing Jenkinsfile For Ansible Deployment
To deploy to other environments, we will need to use parameters.

Update `sit` inventory with new servers

Update `Jenkinsfile` to introduce parameterization. Below is just one parameter. It has a default value in case if no value is specified at execution. It also has a description so that everyone is aware of its purpose.

In the Ansible execution section, remove the hardcoded inventory/dev and replace with `${inventory}`
From now on, each time you hit on execute, it will expect an input

### SIMULATING A TYPICAL CI/CD PIPELINE FOR A PHP BASED APPLICATION

We already have `tooling` website as a part of deployment through Ansible. Here we will introduce another PHP application to add to the list of software products we are managing in our infrastructure. The good thing with this particular application is that it has unit tests, and it is an ideal application to show an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a particular application.

Our goal here is to deploy the application onto servers directly from `Artifactory` rather than from git.

Install Configure Artifactory (_Spin up a new Ubuntu 20.04 EC2 Instance_)

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install gnupg2 -y

wget -qO - https://api.bintray.com/orgs/jfrog/keys/gpg/public.key | sudo apt-key add -

sudo echo "deb https://jfrog.bintray.com/artifactory-debs bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jfrog.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install jfrog-artifactory-oss -y
```

### Start the Artifactory service and enable it to start at system reboot with the following command

Add port 8082 to the ec2 instance security group

### Prepare Jenkins
 
Fork the php-todo repository ``https://github.com/darey-devops/php-todo.git``

Install the following packages:

```
sudo apt install -y zip libapache2-mod-php phploc php-{xml,bcmath,bz2,intl,gd,mbstring,mysql,zip}
```
 
### Integrate Artifactory repository with Jenkins

Create a dummy `Jenkinsfile` in the repository

Using Blue Ocean, create a multibranch Jenkins pipeline

On the database server, create database and user


```
Create database homestead;
CREATE USER 'homestead'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'sePret^i';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'homestead'@'%';
```


Update the .env.sample file with your db connectivity details

Update Jenkinsfile with proper configuration
